What is Piecemeal?
Piecemeal is a little PowerShell module that helps solve a big problem: PowerShell extensibility.
Piecemeal allows function and scripts to have extended capabilities and act as extensions for any command.
Piecemeal standardizes these capabilities and provides a simple function you can embed into any module to power an engine of extensibility.
